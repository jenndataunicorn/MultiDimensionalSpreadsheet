# MultiDimensionalSpreadsheet
Desktop app to enter, calculate and display spreadsheet-like values organized along two or more category axes by individual category values. Rearrange categories along different axes to obtain different insights. Apply formulas to one or more while categories or to individual category values. 
Inspired by the flexible nature of apps like Lotus Improv and Quantrix Modeler.

Note: Originally upgraded this solution from VS2010 up through vs2012/2013/2015/2019, and even to the SDK-style projects, but perferred the lighter environment of 2010 and the ability to use the older stlye setup project, so ported projects back. Currently setup projects are notyet  operational again.
